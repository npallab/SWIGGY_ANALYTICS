This project focuses on practicing SQL analytics using a sample Restaurants table. The table stores various attributes related to restaurants, such as their location, name, average price, average ratings, and more. The purpose of this project is to provide a comprehensive set of SQL queries to practice and enhance SQL analytics skills.

The Restaurants table has the following structure:

    Address VARCHAR(255),
    DeliveryTime INT
);
```
